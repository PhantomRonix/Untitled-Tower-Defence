The final assessment of a now-concluded module, scoring a total of 80%.

Imports data from a text file to read both map data, and leaderboard data.
Also uses sprites I generated using Blender's freestyle feature and some primitives

I remember my assessor made a note about how clicking didn't directly kill enemies, but ultimately dismissed it because it was more vast than other projects.
